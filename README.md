# Intro-Deep-Learning-Notebooks

by Eleanor Quint

I put together these Jupyter notebooks for use in teaching CSCE 496/896 Intro to Deep Learning at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Students have given me a lot of feedback that these have been valuable learning resources, so I thought I'd make them public!

Currently, These hackathons are direct dumps from teaching Spring 2019's CSCE 496/896 at UNL used on HCC's Crane cluster. Thus, every one of these hackathons is going to have something broken. Much of this should be easy to fix (e.g., choosing the right kernel and updating where the dataset is loaded from), but there might be some more obscure things. The notebooks presently run on TensorFlow 1.9, but I'll soon be updating them to TF 2.0 for teaching in Fall 2019.

Please email me at equint@cse.unl.edu with any questions, comments, feedback, or suggestions! (or just to tell me that you used these!)

This repository is presently unlicenced. I will say that I'm generally cool with any personal or academic use which is cited and not for profit. Further, if anything is derived from this repo, it must not be used toward any evil or unethical end. Further, if I used your work without properly citing you, please please please get ahold of me and I'll correct that mistake.
