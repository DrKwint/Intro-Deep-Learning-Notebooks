The key function to implement is `__call__` which should take in data, run the model forward, and return the output.

If you use the browser, login and then use the dropdown: `Clusters > Crane Shell Access`. Because this shell is on the login node, you shouldn't run your jobs directly. Instead, you can submit your job to a cluster node to be run with a GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Get the slurm submit script and set up your anaconda environment\n",
    "Try this out by saving the following bash script as `submit_gpu.sh` and change `<your env name>` to the name of your anaconda environment. You should create the anaconda environment by following the [Crane docs](https://hcc.unl.edu/docs/applications/user_software/using_anaconda_package_manager/#creating-custom-gpu-anaconda-environment) replacing the first `module load` command with `module load tensorflow-gpu/py38/2.3`.\n",

    "#### 3. Submit a job\n",
    "Once you've got your script, you can run it like so to submit a job: `sbatch submit_gpu.sh python <filepath>.py`. This will submit a job to the `cse479` partition. Each student is only allowed one job at a time on this partition, and you may check the status of your jobs with `squeue -u <username>`. If you would like to submit more than one job (which we encourage generally), you can submit the extras to the `cse479_preempt` partition by substituting in the line `#SBATCH --partition=cse479_preempt`. You can submit an unlimited number of jobs to this queue, but they may be interrupted anytime another student needs a gpu on the `cse479` partition and there are no others available. Thus, we reccomend saving your model periodically so that you can restart training from where it was interrupted rather than having to start all over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can cancel jobs with `scancel <JOBID>`, where the job ID is the number associated with the job you can see in squeue or right after you submit the job, or with `scancel -u <username>` which cancels all your running jobs. For more details, please visit the [HCC docs](https://hcc-docs.unl.edu/), ask a question on Piazza, or come to office hours."
