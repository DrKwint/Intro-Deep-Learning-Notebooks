Thus, rather than training with a particular dataset, we're going to create an environment with which to interact. The model will take in the environment state and choose an action to take. We want to train the model to choose the best action in any given state.\n",

    "We're going to use an approach to optimization called \"policy iteration\". This is where we instantiate a random policy (parameterized by a deep neural network) and optimize it in steps. The basic algorithm in this approach is called \"REINFORCE\" In each step we'll collect experiences from the environment for one episode (e.g., in Cartpole, from the initial state of the simulation until the pole falls too far). After the episode we'll calculate how well the policy did and update it to perform better next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The family of algorithms we're going to use is a type of policy iteration called \"Actor-critic\". So called because we're going to create an actor network (the policy) and a critic (the value network). The actor will take some actions in the environment and the critic will evaluate a baseline for how good those actions should be. If the actions turn out better than the baseline, the actions are reinforced. Otherwise, if the actions are worse than expected, they are reduced in probability."

    "More specifically, we're going to use an algorithm called \"Proximal Policy Optimization\". The key element this algorithm adds to the actor-critic family of algorithms is a limit to how much it can change the policy in one round of training. This ensures that the policy remains stable and gets better more or less monotonically. The mechanism used to limit the change is the KL divergence between the distribution over actions before and after training."
