    "1. Input data should be 4-dimensional with shape (batch, height, width, channels), unless the data_format argument is specified.\n",

    "3. Specifying `strides=n` for some n > 1 will result in an output image multiplicatively smaller than the input by a factor of n. Make sure that n isn't greater than the filter size unless you intend to completely ignore part of the input.\n",

    "This architecture of a convolutional stack followed by dense layers for classification is pretty typical. It has the major advantages of making spacially local transformations to the image, followed by a global transformation which makes the final classification decision. You might notice as well that the number of filters goes up after each convolution. This is to allow higher layers to learn more specific patterns, so we require more of them than the general patterns of the earlier layers.\n",
